		<p>The HEV Suit, or Hazardous EnVironment suit, often called the "Hazard Suit" for convenience, is a full-body hazardous materials suit developed at the Black Mesa Research Facility. Designed for Black Mesa scientists to protect themselves from radiation, energy discharges and blunt-force trauma during the handling of hazardous materials</p>
		<p>The HEV Mark IV suit has a built-in flashlight, Geiger counter, morphine administrator, an optional Long Jump Module which allows jumps over large distances, a radio, tracking devices, and a heads-up display (HUD) which tracks health status and weapon ammunition usage, as well as including a weapons management system.</p>
		<p>The suit contains an on-board computer system that constantly monitors the user's health and vital signs, reacting to any changes in the user's condition with activations in the aforementioned apparatus.</p>
		<p>Additionally, the suit has an electrically hardened armor/energy shield system that can be charged at HEV chargers throughout Black Mesa. While charged, the suit provides greater protection from injury as the charge absorbs more than two-thirds of any damage or trauma experienced by the wearer, which is absorbed directly into body-integrity, and oxygen deprivation, caused by swimming without surfacing for long periods of time.</p>
