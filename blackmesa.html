		<p>The Black Mesa Research Facility, or B.M.R.F. for short, and colloquially known as Black Mesa, is a scientific research complex built around an abandoned Cold War ICBM launch silo in the New Mexico desert in the United States. </p>
		<p>The Black Mesa facility is built over several decommissioned ICBM launching and testing silo complexes constructed during the 1950s, which was converted into a vast civilian institute for the research of almost every conceivable scientific discipline.</p>
		<p>Black Mesa undertakes its various scientific researches in the facility, which is a very high-security complex, as each employee is required to undergo a series of rigorous security checks to access most areas. Security guards, carrying firearms and trained for emergencies, are present in all of the facility. The complex is also equipped with retinal scanners and alarms, as well as heavy blast doors that may shut down in case of fire, explosion or other event. Black Mesa can be completely sealed from the outside.</p>
		<p>The facility is self-sufficient, housing its own: ventilation, cold and hot water, central heating, sanitation, drainage, and power generation systems including a Hydro-Electric Dam and multiple types of electrical generators and reactors, some using nuclear technology. Chemical processing plants are also seen and as the facility is located within the desert water treatment plants are required to recycle waste water.</p>
		<p>The complex is dominated by a number of underground laboratories, test areas (including an Anti-Mass Spectrometer), and administration offices, most of which contain very high-tech equipment, and even a rocket launch site</p>
		<p>As employees are required to live in the complex itself, Black Mesa contains many personnel facilities, including laundromats, recreation and sports areas such as lounges, at least one basketball court, at least one swimming pool, a library, fast food outlets, food courts, cafeterias, and numerous vending machines.</p>
		<p>All main Sectors are linked together by the Black Mesa Transit System, the monorail network going through the whole facility.</p>
		<p>Black Mesa is equipped by a public address system, the Black Mesa Announcement System, relaying audible messages and announcements across the facility. It is also used in the Black Mesa Transit System to give general information about the facility and mention each stop.</p>
		<p>The complex also has its own newspaper, The Mesa Times, which is sold within the Black Mesa Research Facility to inform the personnel about events within and outside of the facility.</p>
		<p>Despite being located in the middle of a desert, the underground and indoor sectors of Black Mesa are "maintained at a pleasant 68° Fahrenheit (20° Celsius) at all times", enabled by Black Mesa's sprawling network of ventilation ducts.</p>
		<p>Overall, Black Mesa is almost as large as a city and is completely self-sustainable in all fields.</p>
		<p>In the event of an emergency, the military, are to enter the facility. Black Mesa contains many automated ceiling turrets, which, when activated, will emerge from armored cupolas and fire upon any moving object in their line of sight.</p>
